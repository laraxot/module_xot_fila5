# Laraxot Testing Best Practices

## 1. Core Philosophy: Zen Laraxot
Testing in Laraxot follows the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** and **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** principles. All tests should be robust, maintainable, and highly performant.

## 2. Base Test Case: `XotBaseTestCase`
All module test cases (`Modules/*/tests/TestCase.php`) MUST extend `Modules\Xot\Tests\XotBaseTestCase` instead of the base Laravel `TestCase`.

### Benefits:
- **Centralized Bootstrap**: Application initialization via `CreatesApplication` is handled once.
- **Unified Environment**: Automatically uses `.env.testing` and ensures consistent database state.
- **Common Helpers**: Provides standardized methods like `generateUniqueEmail()`, `getUserClass()`, and `createTestUser()`.
- **Translator Binding**: Automatically binds a mock translator if not present, preventing `BindingResolutionException` in unit tests.

## 3. Database Management: No `RefreshDatabase`
**🚨 CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER use the `RefreshDatabase` trait in any tests.

### Why?
- `RefreshDatabase` is slow as it re-runs all migrations for every test class or even every test.
- In a modular multi-database environment like Laraxot, it can be unpredictable.

### What to use instead:
- **`DatabaseTransactions`**: Use this trait to wrap each test in a database transaction that is rolled back afterward.
- **Manual Migration**: Ensure migrations are run once before the test suite starts (e.g., in CI or via a dedicated command).
- **Factories**: Use the `createTestUser()` helper or model factories to set up the necessary data state.

## 4. Test Framework: Pest
All tests MUST be written in **Pest**. If you find legacy PHPUnit tests, they must be converted to Pest format.

### Key Conventions:
- Use `uses(TestCase::class)` at the top of feature tests.
- Keep tests concise and descriptive.
- Aim for 100% code coverage across all modules.

## 5. Coverage Goals
Every module must strive for **100% test coverage**.
- Run coverage analysis regularly: `./vendor/bin/pest --coverage`.
- Use `pcov` for faster coverage reporting.
- If a test fails, fix it or remove it if it's obsolete. The site is assumed functional; failing tests usually indicate incorrect test logic.

## 7. Environment-Specific Logic
**🚨 CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER use `app()->environment('testing')` or similar environment checks inside Model constructors or core business logic to switch database connections or file paths.

### Why?
- **Hardcoding**: It's a form of hardcoding that makes the code less portable and harder to test in different environments.
- **Hidden Behavior**: It introduces side effects that are difficult to track.
- **Better Alternatives**: Use the `.env.testing` file and Laravel's built-in testing configuration to manage environment-specific settings.

### Correct Pattern:
Instead of:
```php
public function __construct(array $attributes = [])
{
    parent::__construct($attributes);
    if (app()->environment('testing')) {
        $this->connection = config('database.default');
    }
}
```
Use `.env.testing`:
```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql_test
```
And let the framework handle the connection based on the active environment.

## 8. No Redundant Overrides
**🚨 CRITICAL RULE**: NEVER override properties like `$table` in models that extend third-party packages (e.g., Spatie Activitylog, Spatie Event Sourcing) if those properties are already managed dynamically by the package's configuration.

### Why?
- **DRY Principle**: Specifying the table name in both config and model is redundant.
- **Maintainability**: If the table name changes in the config, the model will break or use the wrong table.
- **Encapsulation**: Respect the design of the package you are extending.
