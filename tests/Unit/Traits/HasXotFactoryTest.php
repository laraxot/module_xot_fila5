 * each time breaking Model::factory() across nearly every module in the monorepo
 * (XotBaseModel uses this trait). This test exists so that regression fails loudly
 * here instead of being silently rediscovered module by module — if factory() is
 * missing again, this throws BadMethodCallException instead of silently passing.
 *
 * See docs/chat/2026-09-06-hasxotfactory-factory-method-deleted-root-cause.md and
