/**
 * Provides factory support for models using GetFactoryAction.
 *
 * Usage: just use the trait in your model. No type parameters needed.
 *
 * DO NOT DELETE public static function factory() BELOW. It has been removed by
 * mistake and restored 3 times in this repo's history (2026-09-06/07 — see
 * `git log -- app/Models/Traits/HasXotFactory.php`, commits c81bf340 and 85435893).
 * Without it, EVERY model using this trait (i.e. nearly every model in every module,
 * via XotBaseModel) loses its `Model::factory()` static entry point at BOTH the
 * PHPStan level (staticMethod.notFound cascades) AND at PHP runtime
 * (BadMethodCallException on any `SomeModel::factory()->create()` call — this is not
 * just a type-checker annotation, PHP actually resolves this trait method at
 * call time). `newFactory()` alone does nothing: nobody calls it directly.
 * See second-brain memories `project_phpstan_neon_duplicate_includes_pest_bump.md`,
 * `project_larastan_factory_mixed_needs_newfactory_override.md`, and
 * `docs/chat/2026-09-06-hasxotfactory-factory-method-deleted-root-cause.md` for the
 * full incident history before touching this file again.
